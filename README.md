# Academic Performance Prediction Project 

## Overview

This project aims to investigate the various factors influencing students' academic performance using a comprehensive data-driven approach. The study utilizes data collected through a Google Form distributed to participants, capturing insights into their university experience, lifestyle, and family background. The analysis involves preprocessing raw data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and employing machine learning models for predictive analysis. Challenges such as imbalanced data classes are addressed through alternative approaches.

## Data Collection

Data for this project was collected through a Google Form distributed to participants. The form captured information related to university experience, lifestyle, and family background. The collected data serves as the foundation for understanding the factors influencing academic performance.

## Methodology

The project follows a systematic methodology, including:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Raw data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and any other data cleaning requirements.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** A thorough exploration of the data is conducted to uncover patterns, relationships, and potential insights.

3. **Machine Learning Models:** Various machine learning models are employed for predictive analysis. The models chosen include:
   - RandomForestClassifier
   - DecisionTreeClassifier
   - KNeighborsClassifier
   - AdaBoostClassifier
   - GradientBoostingClassifier
   - XGBClassifier
   - SVC
   - Perceptron
   - VotingClassifier
   - Bagging Classifier

4. **Addressing Imbalanced Data:** Special attention is given to handling imbalanced data classes through alternative approaches.

## Key Findings

The report outlines key findings and insights gained from the evaluation of the machine learning models. These findings shed light on the factors that significantly impact students' academic performance.

## Repository Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- **data:** Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks documenting the data preprocessing, EDA, and model evaluation processes.
- **models:** Saved machine learning models for reproducibility.
- **reports:** Final reports summarizing the methodology, key findings, and insights.
